# Hello-World
This is my first repository in my new account with GitHub. I'm doing it for INFM 109 at Ivy Tech Community College
Hello, my name is Felicia. I am enjoying this course a lot. Github seems like it is very helpful and hope it will be. I have always loved everything dealing with technology and am glad I'm finally taking an IT course so that I can finally get into the field.
